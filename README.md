* You need to install Node.js 
* Go to the project directory and run npm start
* As I build this project using react js for frontend and flask for backend
* You need to sync both end
* I ran both end on same 3000 port
* For that you have to write proxy": "http://localhost:5000/" befor dependencies in package.json
* Then run both reactjs and flask
